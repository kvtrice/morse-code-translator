Welcome! This web app is a simple Morse Code Translator that allows users to translate between English and Morse code in real-time. The site also features an index of accepted characters to make things easier for anyone unfamiliar with morse code.

## Key Features

-   **Real Time Translation**: The text you enter is translated as you type!

-   **Two-Way Translation**: The app supports entry of both English or Morse-Code, with both being translated to the other (From English to Morse and from Morse to English)

-   **Case Handling**: When a new sentence is started the word will be returned with the first letter of the sentence being capitalised, as is convention in English.
